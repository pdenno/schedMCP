The main scheduling challenge involves coordinating the fermentation times for different beer types, as they vary from one to four weeks. Additionally, managing the availability of fermentation tanks, coordinating with ingredient supply chains, and aligning production with packaging schedules are critical aspects that require careful attention to avoid bottlenecks and delays.",
