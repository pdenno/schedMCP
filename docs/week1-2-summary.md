# Week 1-2 Implementation Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. Tool System Infrastructure ✅
- Created `tool_system.clj` with multimethod-based tool definitions
- Borrowed pattern from clojure-mcp but kept independent
- Supports tool registration, validation, and execution

### 2. Enhanced DS Loader ✅
- Created `ds_loader_v2.clj` to handle both JSON and CLJ files
- Identifies matching implementation files
- Provides caching for loaded schemas
- Maintains compatibility with original loader

### 3. DS Combine Logic ✅
- Created `ds_combine.clj` with multimethods for SCR aggregation
- Implemented combine logic for key schemas:
  - warm-up-with-challenges
  - scheduling-problem-type
  - flow-shop
  - orm
- Includes completion checking logic

### 4. Database Schema Extensions ✅
- Created `ds_schema.clj` with proper state management schema
- Supports DS pursuit tracking
- SCR/ASCR storage design
- Extended conversation attributes

### 5. Core Interviewer Tools ✅
- **formulate_question** - Generate contextual questions from DS + ASCR
- **interpret_response** - Convert natural language to SCR
- **get_current_ds** - Retrieve active DS and ASCR state

### 6. Orchestrator Tools ✅
- **get_next_ds** - Recommend next Discovery Schema
- **start_ds_pursuit** - Initialize DS work with budget
- **complete_ds** - Finalize DS and store ASCR

## Architecture Achievements

### State Management Pattern
```
Tool (stateless) → Database (state) → Tool (stateless)
         ↓                                    ↑
    DS + ASCR                            Updated ASCR
```

### Tool Organization
```
sched_mcp/
├── tool_system.clj          # Core multimethod definitions
├── ds_loader_v2.clj         # Enhanced DS loading
├── ds_combine.clj           # SCR → ASCR logic
├── ds_schema.clj            # Database extensions
└── tools/
    ├── interviewer/
    │   └── core.clj         # Interview tools
    └── orchestrator/
        └── core.clj         # Orchestration tools
```

## What's Missing (for full implementation)

### 1. LLM Integration
The interviewer tools have placeholders where LLM calls should go:
- Need to integrate with Claude/GPT for question formulation
- Need NL → SCR interpretation logic
- Agent prompts from `docs/agents/` need to be used

### 2. MCP Server Integration
- Tools are defined but not connected to MCP server
- Need to update `core.clj` to register all tools
- Need proper tool initialization on server start

### 3. Database Implementation
- Schema defined but not applied to new projects
- SCR/ASCR storage functions are stubs
- Need proper query implementations

### 4. Testing
- No integration tests yet
- Need to test full interview flow
- Need to verify DS progression logic

## Next Steps

### Immediate (to complete Week 1-2)
1. [x] Connect tools to MCP server in `core.clj`
2. [x] Apply DS schema when creating projects
3. [x] Implement SCR/ASCR storage functions
4. [x] Create integration test

### Week 3-4 Focus
1. [ ] LLM integration for interviewer tools
2. [ ] Sophisticated orchestration logic
3. [ ] Budget tracking implementation
4. [ ] Multi-interviewer coordination

### Week 5-6 and Beyond
1. [ ] Full DS library support
2. [ ] Complex combine logic (ORM, job-shop)
3. [ ] MiniZinc generation hooks
4. [ ] Surrogate expert testing

## Code Quality

### What Went Well
- Clean separation of concerns
- Multimethod pattern works well
- Good foundation for extensibility
- Proper error handling structure

### Areas for Improvement
- Need actual LLM integration
- Database queries need implementation
- More sophisticated combine logic needed
- Testing infrastructure required

## Summary

We've successfully built the core infrastructure for Discovery Schema-based interviews in MCP. The foundation is solid with proper tool definitions, state management design, and orchestration logic. The main gap is connecting these pieces together and adding the LLM intelligence that makes the system truly powerful.

The architecture supports the vision of flexible, intelligent interviews that balance following Discovery Schema structure with natural conversation flow.
