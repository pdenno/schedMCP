# Integration and Testing Summary

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Tool Registration System
- Created `tools/registry.clj` to unify all tools
- Integrated new DS tools with existing interview tools
- Added automatic DS schema initialization
- Successfully connected to MCP server through `main.clj`

### 2. Database Configuration
- Implemented smart detection of REPL mode using `:nrepl` alias
- Automatically uses `./test/dbs` for local development
- Falls back to `SCHEDULING_TBD_DB` environment variable in production
- This solved the `/opt/scheduling` access issue elegantly

### 3. Database Function Implementation
- Implemented `get-stored-scrs` to retrieve SCRs from messages
- Implemented `get-ascr` to get current ASCR state
- Implemented `store-ascr!` with version tracking
- Fixed nil storage issue by using retraction

### 4. Integration Testing
- Created comprehensive integration test covering full DS flow
- Test verifies:
  - Project creation with DS schema
  - DS recommendation by orchestrator
  - DS pursuit initialization
  - Question formulation (placeholder)
  - Response interpretation (placeholder)
  - DS completion and progression
- All 18 assertions passing

### 5. Bug Fixes During Integration
- Fixed DS ID formatting (namespace/name)
- Fixed nil value storage in Datahike (use retraction)
- Ensured consistent ID formatting across tools

## Test Results

```
Testing sched-mcp.integration-test
Ran 1 tests containing 18 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

## Architecture Validation

The integration confirms our architecture works:

```
User → MCP Tool → Tool System → Execute Tool → Database → Result
         ↓                            ↓
    Registry                    DS + ASCR State
```

## What's Ready

1. **Full tool pipeline** - All tools registered and callable
2. **State management** - Database properly tracks DS pursuits and ASCRs
3. **Orchestration logic** - Properly recommends DS progression
4. **Development environment** - Works seamlessly with local databases

## What Still Needs LLM Integration

1. **formulate_question** - Currently returns placeholder
2. **interpret_response** - Currently returns placeholder
3. **Agent integration** - Need to use agent descriptions from `docs/agents/`

## Next Steps

With successful integration, we can now:
1. Add LLM calls to interviewer tools
2. Test with actual Claude/GPT integration
3. Implement more sophisticated combine logic
4. Add more Discovery Schemas
5. Test with real interview scenarios

## Key Insights

1. **REPL Detection** - Using `(some #{:nrepl} (->> (clojure.java.basis/initial-basis) :basis-config :aliases))` elegantly solves environment differences

2. **Datahike Constraints** - Cannot store nil values; use retraction for removing references

3. **ID Consistency** - Must maintain namespace/name format for DS IDs throughout

4. **Tool Composition** - The registry pattern allows easy addition of new tools

## Summary

We've successfully integrated all components and validated the system works end-to-end. The foundation is solid and ready for LLM integration to make the interviews truly intelligent. The test infrastructure ensures we can confidently add features without breaking existing functionality.
