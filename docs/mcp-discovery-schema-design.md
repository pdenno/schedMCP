# MCP Discovery Schema Architecture Design

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for migrating schedulingTBD's Discovery Schema (DS) system to an MCP-based approach. The current system uses a complex internal protocol with message types like CONVERSATION-HISTORY, PURSUE-EADS, etc. We need to redesign this as MCP tools while preserving the sophisticated orchestration and interviewing capabilities.
The term EADS is deprecated. We use "Discovery Schema" and "DS" instead. I have updated this file to reflect the transition to the new terminology we will try to achieve on implementing.
We will use the terminology Schema-Conforming Response (SCR) for the interviewers interpretation of the natural language (NL) response from interviewees.
We will use Aggregregated Schema-Conforming Response (ASCR) for the "best" summary of the SCR's for a given DS.
The project DB keeps the SCR in the object that also contains the interviewees' natural language response.
The project DB updates the ASCR (not stored with the NL response; stored elsewhere) after formulating the SCR.
The best example DB of this working-- we don't have many --is examples/schedulingTBD/data/projects/sur-craft-beer-4script.edn. Look at the db attribute  :project/summary-dstructs

## Current Architecture Overview

### Key Components

1. **Orchestrator Agent** (see `examples/schedulingTBD/resources/agents/orchestrator.txt`)
   - Selects which EADS (Example Annotated Data Structure) to pursue
   - Monitors conversation progress
   - Directs interview flow across four domains: Process, Data, Resources, Optimality

2. **Interviewer Agents** (4 types) (see `examples/schedulingTBD/resources/agents/iviewrs/base-iviewr-instructions.txt`)
   - Process Interviewer
   - Data Interviewer
   - Resources Interviewer
   - Optimality Interviewer

3. **Core Concepts**
   - **EADS**: Template data structures with instructions for completion
   - **SCR**: Schema-Conforming Responses filled by interviewers
   - **DSR**: Data Structure Refinement messages containing completed schemas

### Current Protocol Flow

```
1. Orchestrator receives CONVERSATION-HISTORY
2. Orchestrator responds with PURSUE-EADS (selects next schema)
3. System sends EADS-INSTRUCTIONS to Interviewer
4. Interviewer receives SUPPLY-QUESTION (with budget)
5. Interviewer sends QUESTION-TO-ASK
6. System relays to user, gets response
7. Interviewer receives INTERVIEWEES-RESPOND
8. Interviewer sends DATA-STRUCTURE-REFINEMENT
9. Repeat 4-8 until EADS complete
10. Return to step 1
```

## Proposed MCP Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Stateless Tools**: MCP tools are stateless, so state management moves to the database
2. **Tool Composition**: Break complex interactions into smaller, composable tools
3. **Natural Flow**: Preserve conversational flow while using tool-based interactions
4. **Flexibility**: Support both human interviewers (Claude) and automated orchestration

### Proposed MCP Tools

 :returns {:success :boolean
           :data_structure :object
           :validation_results :object}}
```

#### Utility Tools

```clojure

           :merged_scr :object
           :conflicts [:object]}}
```

### State Management

Since MCP tools are stateless, we need robust state management:

1. **Database Schema**
   ```clojure
   ;; EADS pursuit state
   {:pursuit-id :uuid
    :project-id :string
    :conversation-id :string
    :eads-id :string
    :started-at :instant
    :budget-allocated :number
    :budget-used :number
    :current-state :eads-working  ;; :eads-selecting, :eads-working, :eads-complete
    :data-structure :object       ;; current working DS
    :questions-asked [{:id :string :question :string :answer :string}]
    :completeness :number}

   ;; Aggregated SCR
   {:project-id :string
    :scr-version :number
    :completed-eads {:eads-id {:data-structure :object
                               :completed-at :instant
                               :version :number}}
    :scheduling-challenges [:string]
    :problem-type :keyword}
   ```

2. **State Transitions**
   - Tool calls trigger state updates
   - Each EADS pursuit is tracked independently
   - Aggregated SCR updated when EADS completes

3. **Key State Management Insights**
   - **Stateless Tool Challenge**: Every MCP tool call must be provided with both the Discovery Schema template and the current ASCR
   - **Pure Function Design**: Each tool becomes essentially a pure function: `(DS, ASCR, new_input) â†’ (action, updated_ASCR)`
   - **State Persistence**: The database must maintain:
     - Individual SCRs (stored with each NL response in conversation history)
     - ASCR (best summary, stored separately in `:summary-dstructs` as seen in `examples/schedulingTBD/data/projects/sur-craft-beer-4script.edn`)
   - **Efficient State Passing**: Tools need strategies for:
     - Fetching relevant DS templates
     - Retrieving current ASCR state
     - Merging new SCRs into existing ASCR
     - Handling conflicts when SCRs provide different values

### Integration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Basic Interview Flow (Current Implementation)
- Simple question/answer tools
- Basic state tracking
- Single EADS support (warm-up)

#### Phase 2: Discovery Schema Implementation
- [ ] Implement EADS library loading from JSON files
- [ ] Create orchestrator recommendation engine
- [ ] Add EADS pursuit state management
- [ ] Implement data structure refinement logic
- [ ] Add validation for EADS completion

#### Phase 3: Full Orchestration
- [ ] Multi-interviewer support
- [ ] Budget management
- [ ] EADS prerequisite checking
- [ ] Conflict resolution for overlapping schemas
- [ ] MiniZinc generation hooks

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Backchannel communication support
- [ ] Dynamic EADS creation
- [ ] Machine learning for orchestration decisions
- [ ] Integration with schedulingTBD visualization

### Usage Patterns

#### Pattern 1: AI-Driven Interview (Claude as Orchestrator and Interviewer)

```
User: "I need help scheduling my brewery"

Claude: [calls start_interview]
        [calls get_next_eads]
        â†’ recommends "process/warm-up-with-challenges"
        [calls start_eads_pursuit]
        [calls get_next_question]
        "What products do you make and what are your scheduling challenges?"

User: "We make craft beer..."

Claude: [calls process_eads_answer]
        [calls get_next_question]
        "Do your products follow the same production process?"

[Continue until EADS complete]

Claude: [calls finalize_eads]
        [calls get_next_eads]
        â†’ recommends "process/flow-shop"
        [Process continues...]
```

#### Pattern 2: Guided Interview (Human orchestrator, Claude as interviewer)

```
Human: "Start the flow shop EADS"

Claude: [calls start_eads_pursuit with "process/flow-shop"]
        [Conducts interview...]
```

#### Pattern 3: Automated Orchestration

```
System: [Periodically calls get_next_eads]
        [Triggers Claude to conduct specific EADS interviews]
        [Aggregates results automatically]
```

### Technical Considerations

1. **Tool Response Sizes**
   - Discovery Schema (EADS) instructions can be large
   - May need pagination or streaming for large schemas
   - Consider caching frequently used Discovery Schema (EADS)

2. **Validation**
   - Discovery Schema (EADS) completion validation in Clojure
   - Schema validation for data structures
   - Type checking for refined values

3. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture for custom Discovery Schema (EADS)
   - Domain-specific validators
   - Custom question generators

### Migration Path

#### Pre-Week 1-2 Preparation Tasks

1. **Fix Current Bugs** (30-60 mins)

   - Make notes about structure and patterns

6. **Set Up Development Workflow** (15 mins)
   - Add helper functions for testing (reset-interview-db!, quick-test-interview)
   - Create shortcuts for common development tasks

7. **Create a Test Checklist** (10 mins)
   - Document what needs to work before DS implementation

4. **Week 7-8**: Polish and extend
   - Add remaining interviewers
   - Implement validation
   - Performance optimization

### Testing Strategy with Surrogate Experts

The system includes a comprehensive testing approach using "surrogate experts" - AI agents that simulate domain experts for various manufacturing domains:

1. **Surrogate Expert Implementation** (see `examples/schedulingTBD/src/server/scheduling_tbd/surrogate.clj`)
   - AI agents configured to act as domain experts in specific industries
   - Respond to interview questions as if managing a company in that domain
   - Generate realistic responses about production processes, scheduling challenges, and constraints

2. **How It's Made Integration** (see `examples/schedulingTBD/src/server/scheduling_tbd/how_made.clj`)
   - Database of ~1600 segments from Science Channel's "How It's Made" show
   - Each segment represents a different manufacturing process
   - Provides diverse test cases across many industries

3. **Proposed MCP Testing Tools**
   ```clojure
   ;; Create a surrogate expert for testing
   {:name "create_surrogate_expert"
    :description "Creates an AI surrogate that acts as a domain expert for testing"
    :parameters {:product :string        ;; e.g., "craft beer", "ball bearings"
                 :expertise_level :string ;; "basic", "intermediate", "expert"
                 :company_size :string}   ;; "small", "medium", "large"
    :returns {:surrogate_id :string
              :system_prompt :string
              :domain_knowledge :object}}

   ;; Run automated interview with surrogate
   {:name "run_surrogate_interview"
    :description "Conducts an automated interview with a surrogate expert"
    :parameters {:surrogate_id :string
                 :ds_sequence [:string]   ;; List of DS IDs to pursue
                 :max_questions :number}
    :returns {:completed_ds [:string]
              :ascr :object
              :transcript :object
              :success_metrics :object}}
   ```

4. **Testing Scenarios**
   - **Unit Testing**: Individual DS completion with predefined responses
   - **Integration Testing**: Full interview flows with surrogate experts
   - **Stress Testing**: Running interviews for all 1600 "How It's Made" segments
   - **Validation Testing**: Comparing generated MiniZinc models against known solutions

5. **Benefits of Surrogate Testing**
   - Rapid iteration without human involvement
   - Consistent, repeatable test scenarios
   - Coverage of diverse manufacturing domains
   - Ability to test edge cases and error handling

### Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - [ ] Can load and execute all existing Discovery Schema (EADS)
   - [ ] Maintains conversation continuity
   - [ ] Generates valid SCRs
   - [ ] Supports orchestration decisions

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - [ ] Tool calls complete in <2 seconds
   - [ ] State persists across sessions
   - [ ] Clear error messages
   - [ ] Extensible architecture

### Open Questions

1. **Orchestration Complexity**: Should orchestration logic be in tools or in Claude's reasoning?
2. **State Granularity**: How much state in DB vs. returned in tool responses?
3. **Discovery Schema (EADS) Evolution**: How to handle Discovery Schema (EADS) version changes?
4. **Multi-user**: Support for collaborative interviews?

### Conclusion

This architecture preserves the sophisticated Discovery Schema system while adapting it to MCP's tool-based paradigm. The key innovation is decomposing the complex protocol into discrete, composable tools that can be orchestrated by either AI agents or automated systems. This provides flexibility while maintaining the domain expertise encoded in the Discovery Schema (EADS) templates.
