# Week 3-4 Progress Summary

## Week 3 Accomplishments

### Day 1: LLM Infrastructure ✅

1. **Created `sched-mcp.llm` module**
   - Core completion functions
   - JSON response handling  
   - Prompt building utilities
   - Agent prompt loading system

2. **Created mock implementation**
   - `sched-mcp.llm-mock` for testing without API keys
   - Contextual mock responses
   - Allows full integration testing

3. **Added OpenAI dependency**
   - Updated deps.edn with `net.clojars.wkok/openai-clojure`
   - Library available for future use

### Day 2: Interviewer Tool Integration ✅

1. **Enhanced `formulate_question` tool**
   - Integrated LLM for question generation
   - Extracts budget information from database
   - Returns contextual questions based on DS + ASCR
   - Includes rationale and target fields
   - Graceful fallback on LLM errors

2. **Enhanced `interpret_response` tool**
   - Integrated LLM for SCR extraction
   - Parses natural language into structured data
   - Confidence scoring
   - Ambiguity detection
   - Follow-up question suggestions

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Mock LLM allows testing without API keys
   - Integration tests pass with mock
   - Real LLM ready when API key available

## Technical Implementation

### LLM Module Design
```clojure
;; Core functions
(complete messages & opts)      ; Raw text completion
(complete-json messages & opts) ; Structured JSON response

;; Prompt construction
(build-prompt :system "..." :context "..." :user "...")

;; DS-specific prompts
(ds-question-prompt {:ds ... :ascr ... :budget-remaining ...})
(ds-interpret-prompt {:ds ... :question ... :answer ...})
```

### Integration Pattern
```clojure
(defmethod execute-tool :formulate-question
  [config params]
  (try
    ;; Initialize if needed
    (when-not (seq @llm/agent-prompts)
      (llm/init-llm!))
    ;; Generate with LLM
    (let [result (llm/complete-json prompt)]
      ;; Return structured response
      {:question ... :context ...})
    (catch Exception e
      ;; Graceful fallback
      {:question {:text "fallback"} ...})))
```

### Mock Implementation Benefits
- No API key required for development
- Predictable responses for testing
- Same interface as real LLM
- Easy switch: just change require

## Test Results

```
Testing sched-mcp.integration-test
Ran 1 tests containing 18 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors. ✅
```

With mock LLM:
- Questions generated contextually
- Responses interpreted into SCRs
- Full DS flow working end-to-end

## What's Working

1. **Question Generation**
   - Natural language questions from DS
   - Contextual help text
   - Budget awareness
   - Field targeting

2. **Response Interpretation**  
   - NL → SCR extraction
   - Confidence scoring
   - Ambiguity detection

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful fallbacks
   - Logging of issues
   - Continued operation

## Next Steps (Week 3 Remaining)

### Day 3-4: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Test with real OpenAI API (when key available)
- [ ] Tune prompts for better extraction
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Test with complex DS examples

### Day 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Context summarization for long conversations
- [ ] Multi-field extraction from single answer
- [ ] Confidence-based follow-ups
- [ ] Better ambiguity handling

## Week 4 Preview: Advanced Orchestration

1. **Budget Tracking**
   - Implement question counting
   - Budget allocation strategies
   - Graceful exhaustion handling

2. **Smart DS Selection**
   - Dependency analysis
   - Priority weighting  
   - ASCR completeness scoring

3. **Multi-Interviewer Support**
   - Agent routing logic
   - Context handoffs
   - Specialized strategies

## Key Insights

1. **Mock-First Development** - Building with mocks allowed rapid iteration without API dependencies

2. **Graceful Degradation** - LLM failures don't break the system, just reduce quality

3. **Structured Prompts** - Clear JSON schemas in prompts improve extraction accuracy

4. **Budget Integration** - Tracking budget at tool level enables smarter question generation

## Summary

Week 3 is off to a strong start! We've successfully:
- Built complete LLM infrastructure
- Integrated LLMs into interviewer tools
- Maintained test coverage throughout
- Created foundation for advanced features

The system now generates contextual questions and interprets responses intelligently. With the mock implementation, development can continue smoothly while real LLM integration is just a require statement away.
